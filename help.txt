------------------------------------------

You are the Squares!
The right is the Computer and it does what it wants.
The initial conditions are set to Edit Positions and the formations are set to WM and Pyramid.
If you click on the file menu you will get three options : 
"Run Simulation"
"Reset Players" and
"Exit"
Exit obviously exits.. 
 
Run Simulation will run the animation of the players moving to the spot you want them to.
	Before the simulation the computers can be given a favored direction 
	(by doing the same thing you do for picking the human player end location) (They are still random though)
	The higher the number you enter in the box, the longer it will take for the players to reach there designated location.
	
To choose where you want a player to go, Click the square and drag your mouse pointer to the desired location.

Reset Players will reset the players' locations to what they were before you ran the simulation.

If you look at the top of your screen you will see the "Mode" option.
Click on it.
You will see:
"Start Formation"
"Corner Kick"
"Edit Positions"
"Set Conditions"
 
 Start formation allows you to set each side's formation.  Hit submit to see the changes you made!
 Corner Kick sets up a corner kick.... Randomly
 Edit Positions allows you to set up your own formations.  
 Set conditions lets you click on a player and drag to set the ending location.
